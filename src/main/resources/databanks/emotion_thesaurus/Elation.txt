# ELATION

DEFINITION: 
In high spirits; a state of euphoria or exhilaration

POLARITY:
+

PHYSICAL SIGNALS: 
High color, a flushed appearance
A smile or grin that cannot be contained
Laughing 
Squealing, screaming, shouting, whooping, hollering
Falling to one’s knees
Jumping up and down
Talking over one another, babbling
Holding arms up in a “victory V”
Head tipping back, turning one’s face to the sky
Running a victory lap
A beaming face, strong color and sheen
Embracing others
Dancing in place
Whooping loudly
Not caring what others think, a lack of self-consciousness
Enjoying communal happiness, feeling part of the crowd
Repeating words over and over: Wow! or I can’t believe it! 
Flinging out the arms and legs, taking a wide stance
Thrusting the chest out
Eyes wide and glowing
Grabbing at the sides of the head in an “I can’t believe it” gesture
High energy, a bouncing walk or run, skipping
Hugging, kissing, or other displays of affection
Breaking out into a run
Happy tears, shining cheeks
Throwing something into the air—a hat, books, confetti, helmet
Sweating
Thrusting a fist into the sky

INTERNAL SENSATIONS:
Warmth radiating throughout the body
Racing heartbeat, drumming in the chest
Feeling ultra-awake, rejuvenated by adrenaline

MENTAL RESPONSES: 
Thoughts scatter, too excited to think straight
Wanting to be surrounded by family and friends
Feeling vindicated for the effort, sacrifice, or hard work
Revisiting the hurdles leading to this moment
Gratitude to those who helped make this possible

CUES OF ACUTE OR LONG-TERM ELATION:
Tears streaming down the face
Loss of motor control
Trembling muscles 
Sinking to the ground, exhausted
Breathlessness
Losing one’s voice from screaming or shouting
Speechlessness

MAY ESCALATE TO: 
SATISFACTION, PRIDE, GRATITUDE

CUES OF SUPPRESSED ELATION:
A grin that can’t be contained no matter how hard one tries
Bottling up one’s breaths to try and calm down
Self-hugging to contain the feeling
Closing the eyes and covering the mouth
Quivering with the effort of controlling oneself
Looking down to hide a grin

WRITER’S TIP: 
Make a list of the body parts you incorporate when expressing emotion. Are there ones you don’t use at all? Challenge yourself to come up with a unique cue by using one of these “missing” parts, and substitute it for a gesture that is overused.
