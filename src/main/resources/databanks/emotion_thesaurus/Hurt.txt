DEFINITION: 
Suffering grief or mental pain; feeling wounded or aggrieved

POLARITY:
-

PHYSICAL SIGNALS:
Eyes widening, yet brows are furrowed
Swallowing hard
Lowering the head, the neck appearing to shrink
A slow, disbelieving head shake
A trembling chin
Mouth falling open
Flinching, starting
Color draining from the face
Saying How could you? as an accusation
Hunching over as if choking down a sob
Pressing a fist to the lips
Biting down on one’s bottom lip
Gripping a fistful of shirt at the chest level
Holding a hand up, warding others off
Clutching the stomach
The body crumpling in on itself
A hitching chest
Drooping shoulders
Weakness in the knees
An uneven step
Displaying poor balance and coordination
A hand pressing against the throat or breastbone
Stuttering, choking out words
Letting out a whimper
Eyes that water
The mouth opening, but no words forming
Sending someone a long, pained look and then breaking eye contact
A hanging head
Retracting the arms, bringing them close to the torso
Stumbling back a step
Backing up
Spinning away
A grimace that lingers
Clutching at oneself, elbows pressed to the sides

INTERNAL SENSATIONS
Dizziness
Stomach hardening, nausea
A painful tightness in one’s throat
Constricting lungs, making it hard to breathe
Heartbeat seeming to slow or stop momentarily
Weakening muscles, trembling in the limbs
Spots flashing in one’s vision

MENTAL RESPONSES: 
The sense that time has stopped
Thoughts spinning, focusing inward
Shock, disbelief
Dredging up history, trying to understand how it led here
Feeling broken inside

A collapse in body posture

Reacting with anger (screaming, slapping, hitting)

MAY ESCALATE TO: 
DEPRESSION, ANGUISH, ANGER

CUES OF SUPPRESSED HURT:

Unnatural stiffness
Pinching the lips tight to keep them from trembling
Tensing the body to ward off shaking
Lifting the chin
Forcing oneself to maintain eye contact

WRITER’S TIP: 
A natural way to describe a character’s appearance is to show them interacting with their environment. A sense of movement also allows this type of description to flow with the scene as it progresses.
